# MEGA_MIDI_Controller
Arduino MEGA-based MIDI Controller

#### I had a similar project years ago (MIDIconvertor -- and looking at the code, it was pretty awful). I had been working on my VMC project, but had issues with implementation of the multiplexers, so I decided to dig my MEGA out of storage to at least get 16 MIDI controls working.
